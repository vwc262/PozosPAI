BEFORE YOU START:
- you need Unity 6
- you need URP SRP pipline 17 if you use higher please import 17 support pack.
- wind setup is in wind prefab at each scene

Step 1 - You can improve FPS amount by 30% if you change rendering path from forward to deferred at "PC Renderer setting"

So if you need deferred Find File "PC_Renderer" and change Rendering path from forward to deferred. Forward render is ok too but it's slower for big open scenes.

Step 2 - Setup Shadows and other render setups. Find File "PC_RPAsset" 
    - Change shadow distance to 150 or higer
    - Optionaly use 1k or 2k shadow resolution. We used 2k.
    - Turn on HDR if its turned off

Step 3 Go to project settings: 
    - Player and set:  Color Space to Linear
    - Quality settings: Go to quality settings and: 
	     * turn turn off vsync
	     * lod bias should be around 1.5-2 and 1 for low end devices.
                        

Step 4 Find "Unity URP Demo Scene" and open it.

Step 5 - HIT PLAY!:)

About scene construction:

		- Prefab wind manage wind speed and direction at the scene
